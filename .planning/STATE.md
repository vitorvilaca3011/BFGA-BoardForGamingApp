# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Network-first build order — routing decisions are architectural, wrong routing causes catastrophic perf (Pitfall #2, #3)
- [Roadmap]: Sequenced delivery on dedicated channel 2 — resolves out-of-order jitter vs Unreliable, avoids cursor interference
- [Roadmap]: Follow CursorUpdateOperation pattern — bypass board state pipeline entirely for laser ops

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Verify `ApplyOperationCore` fall-through behavior — does it update `_boardState.LastModified`? Need explicit early-return.
- [Phase 1]: Verify `ChannelsCount` bump to 3 has no side effects on existing cursor/board channels.
- [Phase 4]: Overlay isolation strategy needs prototyping — separate `ICustomDrawOperation` vs scoped invalidation.
